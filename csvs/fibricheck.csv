Sort/filter patients in the patient list,"The patient list in the physician dashboard will be updated with a sorting/filtering functionality where patients can be filtered based on the last measurement and the last most severe measurement. It will be possible to filter based on color outcome (red  orange,..) and timestamp. Do you want for example to get a list of patients that had a red measurement today or x days ago. It will be all possible with this new option!

Confirmatory measurements to support clinical decision making,"FibriCheck sees the need for confirmatory measurements when a patient is doing a first time (or the first X times  or after X duration) urgent measurement. This ""request to redo"" reduces the risk of the issues of false positives and it gives even more insights towards the diagnosis of a patient.
