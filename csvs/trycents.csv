Tiered Pricing,"Tiered Pricing is finally here! This amazing feature allows you to create custom pricing schedules for commercial and delivery customers. As a pre-requisite to commercial invoicing  tiered pricing ensures that anytime a commercial customer places an order at your store (in person, online, etc!), they will only see the pricing applicable to them. Similarly, tiered pricing gives you the flexibility to define pricing specifically for delivery services. This will allow you to separate your in-store retail experience and pricing structure from delivery, minimizing confusion for both your customers and your attendants. The best part? You can define pricing for specific delivery windows, zones, zip codes, and more! READ the articles below to get a better understanding of this feature:How to Create a Commercial Pricing Tier on CentsHow to Create Delivery Tiers on Cents
