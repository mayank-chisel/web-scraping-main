This will add them to the To field, and also insert a clickable link for their name.The inserted link behaves as a token.

Sorting messages in the list,"Provide a way to sort messages in the list  by e.g. reversed date (newest at bottom) or sender.Note: This might sound simple, but is actually a difficult feature for Mimestream to add, so we don't expect to be adding this in the short term. Gmail's Web UI has no way to sort messages, and the specifics of the Gmail API make it difficult for us to implement this without a new, hybrid Gmail API + IMAP sync strategy.Tip: If you want to sort by sender primarily to see other messages from the same sender, a helpful tip is to click the sender's address token and then choose ""Search for 'sender@example.com'"".

Labs: Snooze conversations,"Unfortunately  the Gmail API does not currently support snoozing. Please visit the Gmail API bug and ""star"" it to express your interest in this to Google.Unless this gets added, we have added a client-side snooze feature, which can be enabled from the “Labs” tab of Preferences. This will hide the message from your Inbox in Mimestream. However, the message will remain in the Inbox on Gmail's servers (and therefore be visible in the Inbox from Gmail web, Gmail iOS, and other email apps). We won't actually remove the Inbox label from the message, because we can't guarantee that Mimestream macOS will be running to unsnooze the message at the appropriate time (and we don't run servers with access to your account).Once we have a companion iOS client, and the user is using the app there, we will graduate the client-side snoozing feature from Labs, and investigate replaying the state to the server, using the more-frequently-connected iOS device as a fallback to perform the unsnooze.

Please let us know what other variables you'd like to see supported!Unfortunately, the Gmail API does not expose Gmail's internal templates feature, so templates you've created in Mimestream do not sync with Gmail (and vice versa). If you haven't already, please star the Gmail API issue at: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/174678306 in order to help express your desire for this functionality to Google.

Scheduled Send,"The Gmail API does not currently support this  so please star the Gmail API bug to express your desire for this functionality. If Google were to add this to the Gmail API, Mimestream would swiftly adopt support for this.Without Gmail API support, the most robust option for adding this feature is to create an opt-in service that performs the message send at the appropriate time. With any service-assisted functionality, we would have a clear and explicit opt-in process, and utilize the minimum possible scope of access to deliver the functionality requested. The Gmail API fortunately appears to offer a very narrow ""gmail.send"" auth scope that would allow us to build a ""Mimestream Scheduled Send Service"" to just send a draft based on its ID, but not see the contents of the draft (or any other message in the account).

Option to download more (or all) messages,"Add a setting to explicitly control the number of days of email cached locally  or be able to cache all messages in the account locally. Currently, the exact size of the message cache on the device is the result of heuristics. Mimestream is designed to be a lightweight streaming client, which minimizes its use of disk space and enables very fast synchronization. When you scroll to the bottom of the list, additional pages of messages are automatically loaded in, and all of your messages are accessible via search.Additionally, the Gmail API is not optimized for a ""download all messages"" use-case, so given the practical constraints around API quota limits, so there are some technical challenges to overcome here. We have plenty of ideas on how to tackle this, but it's not as simple as just adding an option in Settings that changes a backend constant for number of days cached.
