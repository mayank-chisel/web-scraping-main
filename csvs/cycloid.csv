StackForms: Inventory Integration,"As part of our ongoing efforts to improve StackForms  our forms engine, we will be adding a new widget that connects to our inventory database. This enhancement offers several benefits. Unlike TFState outputs, the inventory does not require outputs to be exposed and all fields can be accessed directly. Additionally, connecting the widget to the inventory allows for a relationship between StackForms input and the inventory. This means that refreshing the pipeline will update with new data stored in the inventory, rather than just being a string. Furthermore, users can populate widget values dynamically using Ansible or third-party products by inserting userdata into the inventory.

Drift Detection: Stay Ahead of Shadow IT and Ensure Governance Compliance,"We are excited to present a potential new addition to Cycloid Asset Inventory - Drift Detection. This feature aims to provide you with the capability to detect and address shadow IT instances promptly  ensuring the security and compliance of your infrastructure.The Challenge: Managing Shadow IT and Configuration ChangesAs businesses scale, managing shadow IT becomes increasingly challenging. The use of undocumented and unapproved IT resources can pose security risks and lead to operational inefficiencies. Additionally, any unauthorized changes to existing resources may inadvertently impact your infrastructure's stability.The Solution: Introducing Drift Detection Drift Detection is designed to be your proactive ally in dealing with these challenges. By continuously monitoring your infrastructure, this feature can detect two main types of deviations:1. Manual Resource Creation Drift: Drift Detection promptly identifies any new resources that have been manually created outside of approved processes. For example, it can flag instances where a subnet is added to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without proper authorization or documentation. 2. Configuration Change Drift: Any unauthorized or unintentional alterations to existing managed resources, such as changes to EC2 instance types, are brought to your attention by Drift Detection. This helps you maintain consistency and compliance across your infrastructure. How Drift Detection Can Benefit Your Governance StrategyWith Drift Detection, you gain the following advantages: Enhanced Security: Detecting shadow IT resources early allows you to take swift action and minimize potential security vulnerabilities. Improved Compliance: Drift Detection helps ensure that your infrastructure remains compliant by identifying unauthorized changes and facilitating remediation. Efficient Resource Management: By promptly addressing drift alerts, you can optimize resource utilization and prevent unnecessary downtime. Have Your Say!We are in the initial stages of considering this feature for implementation. We highly value your input and would love to hear your thoughts on the potential benefits of Drift Detection for your organization.

Cloud Cost Management,"Cloud cost management is Cycloid's newest FinOps feature that allows you to set your cloud cost budget and generates a graphical representation of exactly how it is being spent. It lets you break spending down into categories like organizations  teams, and regions. You can then further sort via filters. These can be per account, per project, by date, and more, and you can use the tags you’ve already created via your cloud provider, making the information even more customizable.The problemWe're sure you don't need too much explanation as to why it's so important to know exactly what your cloud budget is being spent on. What often happens, however, is that the setup of teams gets in the way of true visibility, no matter how important we know it really is. In some companies, especially larger ones, the people managing the cloud bills have no real visibility into the day-to-day reality of the spend. That means that the first time they know what's been used is the day they get the bill, possibly only once a quarter or year! That's too long to be in the dark when it comes to modern hybrid cloud infrastructures and fast-moving business.Another group of people who suffered when things used to be different - those who use multi-cloud. Each of the cloud services offered a breakdown of spending, sure, but there was no way of seeing the breakdown of all the services taken and assessed together. To get around this, some companies opted to manually compile information to create reports. But this still isn't ideal, as it siloes the information in the hands of the report-creator and, apart from anything, is a time-consuming and frustrating job.Enter cloud cost managementCloud cost management is here to make your life easier. Here's how it works.- Add cloud accounts in “Accounts” (AWS, GCP, and Azure for now, and more added on request)- Cycloid collects billing information and creates reports- Interact with these reports via filters- An accessible, graphical representation of data- An accurate breakdown of cloud spendingCloud cost management is a massive step forward for FinOps in your org. It simplifies your toolchain and means you don't need to resort to (yet another) complex tool or workaround. It's also worth pointing out that Cycloid is the only DevOps platform that currently offers this functionality!
