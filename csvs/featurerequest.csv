option for the translator to split/join strings,"It's a huge handicap in Crowdin that it's not possible to split/join strings. In all other CAT tools that I've worked with  it has been an option for the translator to split/join strings.The reasoning here is that one segment/sentence in the source language is not always equivalent to one segment/sentence in the target language – or – several segments/sentences in the source language could be equivalent to just one segment/sentence in the target language.It should be possible to split/join strings for specific language pairs. In this way, only the TM for that language pair would be affected, and the translator would also be given a higher level of flexibility in creating the best translation for their language.
