SEKOIA.IO Agent: Generate its own events for Windows,"SEKOIA.IO for Endpoints is currently relying on the following sources of information to monitor Windows Systems:Sysmon: A monitoring tool that is not installed on Windows Systems by default. This means that the IT administrators need to install it on all Windows Systems and properly configure it.Security Auditing. This is the default auditing mechanism. The default policy is far from good enough for security monitoring  so the IT administrators need to properly define a security auditing policy.The agent should generate its own events to remove the dependency on Sysmon or Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing. At least the following events should be implemented:Process CreationProcess TerminationNetwork Connection: only new connections, not all packetsCreateRemoteThread: a process creates a thread in another processFile Creation: requires efficient filtering to reduce the volume of eventsRegistry Modifications: requires efficient filtering to reduce the volume of eventsDNS Query Results
