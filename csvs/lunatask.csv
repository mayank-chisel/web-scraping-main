[FEEDBACK NEEDED] Morning / Afternoon / Evening Workflow,"We are considering adding a new workflow named ""Morning / Afternoon / Evening workflow"". In this workflow  sections in the task list would be populated from the tasks on the calendar in the exact order they appear on the calendar. Below these three part-of-day sections, you would have “now” and “later”. When dragging a task from “now” onto the calendar for 10 AM, the task would move from the “now” section into the “morning” section above it. This way, one would not need to look at the calendar all the time throughout the day after they planned their day, as the task list would always mirror the order of tasks on the calendar in this workflow. Would you find such a workflow useful? Would you change anything about this? Let us know even when this does not look interesting despite you using time blocking and tell us why.
