Bibliometrics Dashboard,"We are building a Bibliometrics Dashboard with different impact indicators (e.g. citations  usage, tweets, etc.). The dashboard will show the following basic indicators, each as the total number and broken down by discipline. The expectation is that the Bibliometrics dashboard will drive the adoption of standardized practices and help different stakeholders to obtain aggregated data about important indicators.QuestionsHow would this help your work?Who would benefit from this solution?Fill our SURVEY if you want to provide further information.This work is partially supported by the Make Data Count project funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. https://makedatacount.org/

DOI metadata enrichment  (subject area classification) for Data analysis,"One of the deliverables for the Make Data Count (MDC) grant is “Building of and usage of a bibliometrics dashboard on data sharing. The dashboard will show the following basic indicators  each as the total number and broken down by discipline.” This work depends on having enough DOIs with discipline information in the metadata to analyze by the MDC partners. Our metadata gap analysis shows that we do not have adequate discipline information in the DOIs.As part of this, we are working on improving DOI subject metadata by infering information we have from repository subject areas. We will also run a campaign to encourage our members to improve their DOI subject metadata.This work is partially supported by the Make Data Count project funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. https://makedatacount.org/
