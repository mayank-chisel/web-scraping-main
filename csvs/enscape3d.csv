 can be difficult for a user to directly find the geometry/surface/asset in their CAD project. Therefore we want to give our users the functionality to select geometry in the CAD directly via Enscape by giving them the option to select an object not only in Enscape but also in the CAD at the same time. Should the camera in CAD move to focus on the selected geometry?

Save exact sun position in views,"Sometimes the sun position defined by geo location and time of day is not good enough for the results you want to create. Therefore  you can tweak the sun position to your liking in Enscape. However, until now reproducing sun positions was cumbersome because it was not saved in the views. Exactly that functionality we are going to provide. You will be able to decide for every individual view whether you want to save the current Enscape sun position or not, to adjust this behavior to your needs.

Enscape View,"One of Enscape's strengths is that the CAD project is always the single source of truth and therefore no double effort or transfer of work is needed. But this strength is also a limitation in different areas. One of them is the Enscape views  which also need to exist on the CAD side. Therefore we want to assess Enscape-only Views. This means the views created in Enscape would only exist in Enscape and would not be synchronized with the CAD.Would you prefer to trigger a view sync explicitly or to keep them in sync all the time?In which scenarios would you prefer which option?

Assets with Variants üôå,"Assets are a fundamental part of the design process  giving context and life to a project. Assets with variants are groups of the same type of assets that slightly change appearance. For example:vegetation presented in different seasons or growth stages, a lighting object that varies the number of light bulbs,same car model presented with open doors or a driver inside.This will bring variation to our library but avoid the clutter of listing more similar objects. It will enable you to find the best match faster.

Pin Enscape Window on Top,"Not everyone works with two screens or more  so there will be times when both the modeling software window and the Enscape rendering window need to be open and visible simultaneously.
