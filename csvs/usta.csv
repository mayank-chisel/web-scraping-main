Round Robin | RR Playoff | Generate SF Loser Matches,"Allow ST RR Playoff generation to provide a SF loser another match for all flights within a RR playoff.Example: 12 players  4 RR groups of 3 players each. Playoffs for each player/team. Non-elimination. Current situation: Generating playoffs in current system creates Playoff 1, Playoff 2, and Playoff 3. Top finishers in each pool play off in Playoff 1, 2nd place in Playoff 2, etc.Only Playoff 1 provides for a SF loser match. Playoff 2 and Playoff 3 does not generate the extra match for their SF losers.As a result of this, the TDir must manually create draws for the 7-8 match and the 11-12 match. These matches show up in the ""Draw"" section online, not in the ""Draw Stage"" section online - thereby making it confusing and difficult to find. In addition the Playoff 1 SF losers are dropped into a match labeled at ""Playoff 3-4"" which is confusing as well when listed below Playoff 1, Playoff 2 and Playoff 3. I will submit a separate request to allow for renaming and combining the labels on Draw Stage and and Draw.
