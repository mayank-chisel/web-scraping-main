Multiple timeblocks and UI update,"You can now create multiple timeblocks for one task in a given day. So if you have a large task  and want to work on it in multiple, non-consecutive blocks, you can just drag the task into another timeslot. For new users, we've changed the onboard flow so you can set up a few integrations right after you sign up, that way you have your tasks waiting for you the first time you log into Taskable. We've also updated the integrations page, so now you set up integrations from a drop-down menu.

Chrome extension v1,"We are very excited to ship our Chrome extension! Our goal for the extension is to help you stay focused on what you're supposed to be working on  as well as add necessary information and create Actions quickly, from anywhere you are on the web. This is a very early version, and there's lots more to come on both of these fronts. But, here's how it works today. This will work on any Chromium-based browser, including Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera.Get the Taskable extension from the Chrome Web StoreHow it worksFirst, you can see all the Actions from your Today list, and even check them off from the extension. Just hit the extension button, and it will pop up for you.Make sure to give Taskable pole position on your extension listYou can also add new Actions from the extension by clicking (or tabbing over to) the Add New tab. In this first version we don't grab a link or any other metadata about the webpage you are on currently, but that will come soon.Why is GA so bad?Finally, you can link back to the Taskable app by clicking on the Taskable tab.A few things to keep in mind - once you add the extension you might need to pin it so you can always see it in the window. You can do that by hitting the puzzle icon in the top right hand corner of the Chrome window, scrolling down to Taskable and clicking on the pin icon.I've even added a keyboard shortcut so all I have to do is hit **⬆⌘A **to pull up the extension! You can do that by going to chrome://extensions/shortcuts in your browser.That's it for now. Excited to hear your thoughts and feedback!
