Natural Query Language support,"Meilisearch would support natural language filtering and sorting  allowing users to filter and sort search results using everyday language. This feature would enhance the search experience by enabling users to filter and sort results in a more intuitive way, without having to learn complex filtering and sorting syntax. How it WorksMeilisearch's natural language filtering and sorting would use machine learning algorithms to interpret user queries and generate relevant search results. The system would analyze the context and intent behind the query to understand what the user is looking for and generate results accordingly. This feature would also support synonyms, misspellings, and other variations of search terms to provide more accurate and comprehensive results. Use Cases• E-commerce websites: users could filter and sort products using natural language queries, such as ""black dresses under $100 sorted by price""• Job boards: users could filter and sort job listings using natural language queries, such as ""remote software engineer jobs in San Francisco sorted by date posted""If you're interested in this feature, please leave us a comment below by answering these questions: Who are you?

Indexing Metadata,"The problem when using a replicated or HA database is that updates can potentially be slow. They are slow because they must be done sequentially to ensure the ACID property of the database.However  it is possible that the user may need to update data very, very often (several times per minute or second). Some examples. A social network wants to be able to update the number of like items very often. An e-commerce site may want to update the stock to display or not display an item.To allow high-frequency updates, we need to remove some of the consistency from the indexes. This can be done without impacting the rest if we only remove consistency in fields that we know are updated very often.The proposal here is to have a specific route for updating meta-data. This route remains to be defined. Once an update is received, it would go to a different update queue than the document updates. It would have priority. The content of these updates could not be used for indexing, but only for ranking and display: no parsing, no tokenization, no computation on fields.

Field Weighting,"This feature would allow users to assign weights to fields in Meilisearch  improving search accuracy and relevance. By customizing the weights assigned to each field, users would be able to better reflect the relative importance of the data and simplify the configuration process.Today we already have a kind of fields weight by ordering the fields on the searchableAttributes.

Tokenizer for all languages,"Tokenizer's principal role is to split documents into words (tokens) so each document can be indexed by it's contained words. It is also needed to split a search a query into a token  and search on the work index.It turns out that splitting texts into tokens is a complicated task, especially when you need to handle more than a single language. While the task for English may seem trivial at first glance (mostly split white space), Chinese tokenization, for example, is completely different (no spaces between words, groups of 1, 2, or 3 characters...).Therefore, in order to provide the best possible language support for MeiliSearch, we decided to rewrite our tokenizer.Instead of designing a one-does-it-all tokenizer, that handles every language at the same time, we instead thought of a modular one. The goal is to efficiently scan through the text and split it according to the scripts (alphabet kinda) it contains. Once that is done, we define rule specifying which tokenizer to use for which script.

SAML/SSO,"We're considering adding a new feature to Meilisearch Cloud that we think will greatly benefit our users: SAML/SSO authentication! With SAML/SSO  you would be able to use your existing identity provider to authenticate and manage access to Meilisearch Cloud, making it easier to manage your users and improve security. Here's what SAML/SSO could bring to Meilisearch Cloud users:• Simplify user management: With SAML/SSO, you would be able to manage your users in one place, using your existing identity provider. This would make it easier to add or remove users, and ensure that only authorized users have access to Meilisearch Cloud.• Improve security: SAML/SSO provides a more secure way to authenticate users, using industry-standard protocols and encryption. This can help protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.• Streamline access: With SAML/SSO, users would be able to access Meilisearch Cloud with just one click, without having to remember multiple usernames and passwords. This can save time and reduce the risk of password-related security issues. We're always looking for ways to improve Meilisearch Cloud and make it even more useful for our users. With SAML/SSO, we believe that you would be able to manage your users more efficiently and keep your data more secure than ever before.

Index CSV Format,"Currently  the engine only accepts JSON format as a data source. We want to give users the possibility of another simple data format, well known, to use.Thus, give them more versatility at the data source choices for the indexing (add and update) step.Since most SQL engines or SQL clients can easily dump data as CSV, it will facilitate MeiliSearch adoption by extending the indexing step on a wider range of customer cases than before.Writing performance is also considered as motivation since CSV parsing is less CPU and memory-intensive than parsing JSON due to the streamable capability of the CSV format.How do we imagine this feature?We need to propose a simple way to type the data before injecting it into the engine. We imagined being able to specify the type number in this way. The default type is a string.""id:number"",""label"",""price:number"",""colors"",""description""

Scoring function,"Meilisearch's scoring function allows users to bring custom logic inside the search engine by creating a function that has access to the indexes data in order to calculate a score. This feature offers a high degree of flexibility and control over how search results are ranked and returned.With the scoring function  users can define their own ranking algorithm based on any criteria they choose, such as the relevance of the search term to the document, the popularity of the document, or any other factors that may be relevant to their specific use case. This can be particularly useful for applications that require more complex ranking algorithms or for cases where the default ranking algorithm may not be suitable.
