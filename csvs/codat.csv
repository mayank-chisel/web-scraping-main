Ability to Update Expenses (Xero),"What is the problem? Currently if an SMB needs to alter an expense (including any reconciliation information i.e. category  amount) they would need to make changes to their expense management platform and their accounting package separately. This can be time consuming as making expense alterations are not uncommon tasks. Why is it important?Helps companies to close their books faster and more accurately

Record Supplier Expenses,"What's the problem?Today  sync for expenses records all expenses against a single vendor - in some cases SMB's may want to record expenses against specific vendors. We currently only record an expense against a single client because we don't want to fill the accounting platform with hundreds of suppliers, and need a more elegant way to handle this. Clients usually split their suppliers by value of spend (i.e high spend goes against a different supplier compared to lower spends). It can also be split by seeing how much you spend per company i.e. how much to do spend on flight tickets etc.
