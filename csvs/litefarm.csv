Tasks V2.0,"In the current version of the app  Logs are a way to document activities that have taken place on your farm already. We'll be expanding this idea to activities that will take place in the future as well. With the new update to tasks, farmers will be able to assign tasks to specific individuals on the farm and be notified when the task is complete. Once complete, the task will serve as a document of the activity for certification (similar to how logs work today). You can read more about tasks here: https://lite-farm.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LITEFARM/pages/224788481/Task+Management+System+incorporating+Tasks+Finished+Tasks+and+Notification

Smarter crop catalogue,"Our new crop catalogue will be ""smarter"" and more closely aligned with how farmers actually think about and work with their crops. It will also support all the necessary information to certify a crop organic.Perhaps most importantly  much of the data you need to enter into the system manually today, such as:Annual vs. perennialEstimated yieldPlanting methodDays to germination, transplant, harvest, etc.Furthermore, once you've created a crop plan, LiteFarm will also automatically create all the tasks you'll need to make sure your season goes right!

Modify harvest task to enter harvest uses later,"We should have the option to enter the use of a harvest task at harvest time or later on. Oftentimes  the use of a harvest is determined based on what isn't sold. For example, when harvesting 100 kg of beans, I don't know how many kg I will sell, how much I'll eat, and how much we'll exchange. Only at the time of selling will I know how much has been sold and/or used for other channels.

Copy a crop plan,"The ability to copy over completed and abandoned crop plans.

Designate a sub-location for crop in a location,"Right now crop management plans are assigned locations  but there's no way to know the physical placement of the crop within the location. Moving forward, it could be convenient to draw a shape or drop a pin within a location designating specifically where my crop will be grown within the location.Bonus idea: It would be nice to be able to designate multiple crops as being intercropped in a specific location, and have the visual indicator make that obvious.Super bonus idea: Add filters to the map to allow showing individual crop sub-locations.
