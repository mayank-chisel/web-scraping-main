The four sessions - Monastery Experience, Survive, Build your castle and Death Match - will continue until global feedback on them is positive enough.Every update will include new features and various improvements based on your feedbacks.It's crucial to remember that the Alpha version is likely to be the most bug-ridden and least representative of the final version of the game.The goal of those alpha session is to refine and enhance the experience to bring you the best Rooted experience.When?Announced as ""Early 2023"" on the Kickstarter page (no later than June), and then announced for May on our Discord server, the alpha should be available by the end of Q2 2023.We know that you're eager to play Rooted, but it's important for us to be proud of the build that we'll make available to you.
