New parameters included: TMOD and PREC,"Release date: 10 August 2018Solar radiation calculation scheme has been improved for Americas  Middle East, Asia and Pacific by implementing better management of raw satellite data. The values of GHI, DNI, DIF, GTI and PVOUT parameters are affected by new version of the Solargis model only in rare cases related to a specific segment geometry. New parameters have been introduced (available via API and FTP): PV Module Temperature (TMOD) and Precipitation Rate (PREC). TMOD is useful for evaluation of daytime temperature of PV modules, and for calculation of temperature-corrected performance ratio. PREC can be used for improved understanding of soiling and cleaning of PV modules. Nowcasting service was extended to Australia, Morocco and Canary Islands Geographical coverage of forecasting service based on postprocessing of the IFS outputs (the model operated by ECMWF) was extended to Northeast China, Turkey, Jordan, New Caledonia, Kenya, Morocco and Canary Islands.

Minimum design temperature,"As a PV engineer  in order to correctly size the array (determine number of modules that can be connected in series in a string) it is required to know the lowest expected operational temperature. The lowest operational temperature is mostly likely to be achieved during dawn, when temperature is lowest and first rays of sun start to shine on the modules. Current PV tools simply use a default value i.e. -20deg C or rely on data based on sparsely distributed meteo stations. Thus it would be useful for the industry to have a reliable data source for minimum design temperature. To solve this problem, we have created a new data layer providing minimum design temperature for array sizing. As per the IEC 62738, this has been calculated as the mean of annual extreme low temperatures. We are currently working on making this data accessible via the Prospect app.

Improved blending of NWP forecast models and nowcasting,"Release date: 12 September 2020New feature - Blended forecastsFor Europe  forecasts for lead time from 2 hours up to 120 hours is now based on blending of forecasts from 2 NWP models - IFS (ECMWF) and ICON-EU (DWD). In general, IFS is considered as the best performing global NWP model. Yet, we've seen many instances when the IFS forecasts error was quite high. To limit the occurrence of large forecast errors, henceforth a blended forecasts of IFS and ICON-EU models will be used.Old approach:ICON-EU data now usedNo blending of nowcasts and IFS forecasts for lead time of 2-4 hoursNew approach:Blending of IFS and ICON-EU model for lead time of 2+ hoursBlending of nowcasts and NWP models for lead time of 2-4 hoursOverall, the new approach is expected to improve accuracy of both intra-day and day-ahead solar power forecasts.Currently, forecasts from the ICON-EU model is being used only for Europe. We are working on implementation of forecasts of ICON model also for other regions.Bug fix:Solar radiation data for West Coast of USA and Canada, and Hawaii, for late afternoon hours on first and last day of each month (in 2020) was incorrectly calculated resulting in underestimation of cloud coverage. The issue was fixed and data for all affected days in 2020 was recalculated.

Stochastic generation of 1-min time series,"Release date: 7 November 2019For many PV modelling applications it is preferred to have solar irradiation data in 1-minute or 5-minute time step. However  long history of measured solar radiation in 1 minute time step is not easily available. Nor is it possible to receive satellite imagery with frequency of 1-minute.We have created a model for stochastic generation of 1-minute solar radiation data from native data resolution of 10/15/30 minutes.

Global coverage of operational data services,"Release date: 26 May 2020We achieved global coverage (between latitudes 60N and 50S) for recent and historic data already few years back. Yet  there were some gaps in the coverage for operational data services. These gaps were in overlapping satellite zones, where we had satellite imagery from more than 1 satellite mission. As a result a decision making process was required to define which satellite data source should be use.The simple solution would have been to draw a straight line to define the coverage for different satellites. But this was not an acceptable solution, as it would result in spatial inconsistency of the solar radiation outputs. As a solution, we have carefully defined the border of the satellite coverage zone to be along physical and political borders. This way the spatial consistency is mostly maintained and our customers can now request data for any location between 60N and 50S latitudes via API. Also the delivery time for historic data via climData online app in these regions is now 5-10 minutes instead of 1 working day.

In next release it is planned to allow user to edit the rotation limitsCurrently it is possible only to select option with backtracking strategy enabled. Prior to the release of this feature we have done extensive cross-validation of the Solargis PV simulation model with that of PVsyst and NREL SAM. Whilst there is a good match in results between Solargis and PVsyst for trackers without self-shading (backtracking enabled) there are significant deviations in results for 1-axis tracker without backtracking. For this reason  further validation is required before we support 1-axis trackers without backtracking.
