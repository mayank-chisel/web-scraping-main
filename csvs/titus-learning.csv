Built in avatar generator (SVG),"üìù Summary An investigation piece will occur around how we could look to include an automatic built in avatar/profile picture generator (based on colours chosen in the theme settings).‚ú® Details Many users often do not upload user profile photos to some learning platforms. This results in the default blank profile photo being used. The implementation of auto generated avatars would be overwritten if users add their own profile photos. These profile photos generated would be fairly basic  ideally incorporating branding selected by administrators.üìì Additional Information We will need to ensure an investigation into existing tools (open source ideally) that exist in the wider landscape.üìñ¬†User Story As an... administrator of the platform. I want to... enable and control the branding of automatically generated avatars for my users. So that... profile photos are not all identical for users who haven't uploaded a profile photo and improve the brand awareness across the site.

My Courses - starring courses - when courses are starred  they appear at the beginning of the 'my courses' list automatically,"üìù Summary When a user stars a course via a tile  by clicking for star icon, starred courses should show first (primary sort order), in the My courses area.‚ú® Details When you star a course on Moodle, it is generally just reflected in the starred courses block, which is used very infrequently. This is a proposal to ensure when a course is starred, where you are enrolled, it will show first (primary sort order) on the 'My courses' page.üìì Additional Information There is a consideration here into firstly, can this be a live change (i.e. no refresh) and also, if a user stars a course that they are not enrolled in (from elsewhere), this course will only appear in the starred courses block and not in 'my courses', but this is expected behaviour.üìñ¬†User Story As a... user who visits a number of courses for my eLearning. I want to... star certain courses I'm enrolled in on the platform, to indicate their importance. So that... I can navigate to the 'My courses' page and view these at the top of the list so I can access them quickly.

Site home - add central block region to site home page,"üìù Summary The ability to add blocks onto the Site home will be reintroduced  but in the central region of the page (not side block drawer).‚ú® Details The theme will re-introduce the ability add blocks onto the 'site home' page. This is key for any organisations using blocks such as the 3rd party ecommerce solution 'IntelliCart', where the shop interface is entirely through a block.A central block region will be added below the slideshow and shortcuts. If these 2 elements are not used, the block region will appear at the top of the page.A second central full width block region will be added below all content on the 'site home' page, to provide more flexibility (e.g. adding calendar block). In addition to this, a 3 column block draw will be added below. Once again, this adds flexibility to adding core or plugin blocks for different uses of the Site home page.üìñ¬†User Story As a... site administrator who manages the site home page. I want to... be able to blocks onto the central region of this page. So that... my users can access additional information presented via blocks, such as ecommerce plugins (IntelliCart) through the use of the Product catalog block.

Admin quick links - ability to customise admin quick links,"üìù Summary This is a request to be able to decide which admin quick link menu items are shown in the 'admin quick links' menu. ‚ú® Details This request should consider:The ability to enable/disable key menu items.The ability to re-order menu items.The ability to categorise menu items in the available categories.üìì Additional Information It is unlikely we are able to effectively allow for organisations to add their own custom quick links as this has the potential to cause problems with Moodle permissions against roles. If certain menu items are enabled  they will show for certain users whereas if that same user doesn't have the ability to view one of the areas, the menu item should not show. Each menu item should be linked to the relevant Moodle capabilities.üìñ¬†User Story As an... administrator logged into the LMS. I want to... be able to configure the admin quick links menu (enable/disable certain link items). So that... I can make this list more effective by holding only key menu items for my organisation.

Moodle Workplace - 'My teams' block styling,"As part of v1.2 we are hoping to introduce Moodle Workplace support for our Moodle theme. As a baseline  the tenant selector and Workplace launcher will be introduced into the themes top navigation bar.As part of v1.2 we are also aiming to improve the My Teams page. In Workplace, if you are assigned a team through the organisation structure, you can be granted access to a 'My teams' page. This page contains the Teams block. This block can be added to any site level page where there is the ability to add blocks.This block shows your assigned team members who you manager, along with a host of information such as their current job titles & departments and more crucially, their progress on courses (new in MWP 4), programs and certifications.We are aiming to restyle this block to highlight the most important/key information and bring it to the forefront of this area.

Dark mode,"üìù Summary Introduce a user toggle within the theme to allow users to enable/disable dark mode.‚ú® Details There are numerous solutions/methods to achieve a 'dark mode' for users. There are a number of benefits around accessibility but also as far as saving battery life on devices etc. Dark mode would have predefined settings and could be toggled on or off depending on the users preference. This toggle would live in the top navigation bar.üìñ¬†User Story As a... user accessing the platform. I want to... be able to toggle on 'dark mode' on the Moodle site. So that... I can navigate around and complete my learning with a darker based theme that is easier on the eyes and also helps save battery life on my device. I'd like to be able to toggle this on or off depending on my preference and have this preference remembered upon logging out and back in again later.

Profile page improvements,"üìù Summary This is a proposal for a mock-up to be created to allow for a new version of the Moodle LMS 4.0 profile page to be improved within the theme.The profile page is often overlooked within the platform  however is actually a key way to access a number of links, both for the users themselves and for administrators. The page itself can be somewhat ""noisy"" by default, displaying a lot of information. This proposal is to investigate what can be turned on/off in the form of a theme setting, and what can we introduce to allow new options/settings to automatically appear in an easy to digest manner. For example when certain plugins are installed (e.g. CPD), users would generally access their profile pages first to find the link to log their CPD.

Updated interface on mobile devices,"‚ú® DetailsIn summary  our current Moodle theme does not work as well as we would like on mobile devices. The mockup below is what we plan on having as the display under the suitable breakpoint (I believe under 576px).Please note the burger menu is now top right (easier for thumb), the logo is now present on the top nav, and there is a secondary bar beneath. Right now, I would advise making this grey, unless there are objections to this.The Workplace tenant selector should truncate with ... after a set number of characters (to be defined). The Moodle workplace launcher should still act as a dropdown but we should tidy this up slightly. The language selector should move to the burger menu, only if the existing setting to add it to the top nav bar is enabled.Each of the remaining buttons should now change their targets not to open drawers, but to take you to a specific page (also note the icons are now smaller):Global search - Takes you to /search/index.phpCalendar - Takes you to /calendar/view.php?view=monthMessaging - Takes you to /message/index.phpNotifications - Takes you to /message/output/popup/notifications.phpAdministration ~~ MOVE UNDER BURGER MENU ~~ link takes you to /admin/search.phpProfile ~~ MOVE UNDER BURGER MENU ~~ link takes you to /user/profile.phpAgain, we need to be careful not to define colours as they'll go off brand for clients. These should be tied into the existing colour settings where possible.

Global search results page improvements,"üìù Summary This is a proposal for a mock-up to be created to allow for a new version of the Moodle LMS 4.0 global search results page to be improved within the theme.The global search functionality offers search results to the end users that can appear somewhat clunky and difficult to browse through. This is a proposal to investigate how we can improve the search the results page through the theme  to assist users in finding their desired content more quickly.
