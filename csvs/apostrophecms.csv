Permissions,"Permissions in 2.x were painted in broad strokes. We provided very little functionality and opinion at the point of installation  but give developers an infinite range of options to establish their own governance via groups and named permissions, via a rather opaque interface. In our stable release of 3.0, we'll be taking a different approach, offering a standard set of roles in our core installation, with the ability to customize user groups through an additional Groups extension.

Activity Monitor,"For complex batch operations  such as large data imports and exports, image uploads, etc, it's necessary to provide granular affordance regarding the completion of the task. Our notifications system is not suitable for complex operations like this.

Converting HTML templates to A3,"Using pre-made templates can provide significant time savings when creating a site. Although Apostrophe uses the Nunjucks templating framework  converting an HTML-only site over to accept page data is a quick and easy task.

A new section called ""snacks"" would be created within the Cookbook. This section would serve as a quick reference for completing common tasks and would typically consist of a short explanation and a few lines of code.

Migrate to Vitepress,"Our current documentation site for Apostrophe 3.x has poor search capabilities and a confusing menu setup. To address these issues we will migrate our current document pages from Vuepress to the newer Vitepress. The built-in search functionality of Vitepress is superior to what we currently have with deeper searching and multiple view modes. Additionally  we will create a custom theme that organizes all of the pages into a single, more streamlined navigation tree.

Structured Logging,"Logging of all login attempts and related phenomena is a common feature of application frameworks that Apostrophe does not currently provide. After considering several approaches  we have arrived at an approach that encourages structured logging from the beginning while retaining the best features of the existing implementation, avoiding duplication of features readily available elsewhere, and making it easier to leverage built-in features of popular logging backends like Pino. This will be an API that enforces logging of information in a structured way such that in the right storage backend, the logs can be easily queried. Our approach will allow for logging enough information about login attempts and related phenomena to make auditing those events later possible. It also simplifies and encourages structured logging by introducing the idea of a log entry type as well as automatically logging the name of the module responsible.

User-Specific Language Preference,"The goal is to decouple i18n static so that an editor can choose their own language settings  which would be separate from the locale or language that the template is in. Imagine I'm a French editor working on a Spanish locale template: I can choose to see the admin UI in French and the template in Spanish.This would be a first step toward a more complete User Settings & Preferences experience.

Draft Mode,"One of the most popular aspects of apostrophe-workflow in 2.x was the ability to create Draft content and move it through a hierarchical approvals process before making content live.

Recipe for creating a charting widget extension,"Have you ever wanted to use a data source to drop a chart onto your page? This recipe would walk through the implementation of a widget to power the front-end chart.js library to create graphs from uploaded CSV files.

This would also have to touch on caching and further data processing, given that not all APIs will expose data in the same format.The chart.js library can make complex graphs with multiple data sets plotted on the same axes. Gathering input from the Editor would require customized Vue input components to provide a pleasurable UI/UX experience. For this reason, the initial project would likely only utilize a subset of the chart.js options.Depending on interest, these may be brought back into either the initial project recipe or in follow-up recipes.

Custom User Groups,"The advanced Groups module will provide additional capabilities for Admins  who will be able to assign Editor, Contributor, or Guest access to specific content types through user-groups. For example, an Admin could create a new group called Product which assigns the Editor role for blog posts, but only the Contributor role for pages. Another group called Customers might grant the Guest role for blog posts, allowing access to gated content. Users can be in multiple groups, and all users must be in at least one group. Users receive the highest privilege level available in their group matrix. For example, if the user is in a broadly defined “Editors” group which reflects the permissions of the “Editors” role, and also in a “Product Managers” group that gives them Editorial access to just Products, the “Editors” group would supersede this.
