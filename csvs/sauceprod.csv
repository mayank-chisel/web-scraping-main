Improve Virtual USB (vUSB) Solution,"* Performance & Reliability* Make it easier to adopt and get started with* Make test assets available* Improved Architecture* Make it easy for us to track user engagementCustomers cannot see any record of virtual USB sessions through Sauce Labs' test history. Virtual USB is becoming more commonly used in automation scenarios  which leads to a problem where test failures are hard to debug, due to the lack of data available (device logs, screen recordings, etc) after the test session has ended.

User in multiple teams,"Creating teams is useful for organizations having multiple teams working on different products  belonging to different business units or might be geographically dispersed. Rather than belonging to just one team, users often work on multiple projects and collaborate with different teams. Unfortunately that scenario is not supported by the current team management. Today users can be assigned to one team only. When a user has to navigate between teams in order to contribute to different projects Org admin gas to manually move that user from one team to another. When we take into consideration the high repeatability of such actions we come to the conclusion that this is a very time-consuming and inefficient solution that causes our customers a headache. Additionally, private mobile devices can only be allocated to one team at a time. Therefore, if a person needs to use two different pools of devices, they need two accounts or they have to be moved by the org admin, which again is time-consuming and inefficient.
