Smart Views,"Smart Views give you the ability to create sub-tabs by saving the filtered state of a page. In the end  this helps you access the information you're after faster because you don't have to use the filters on, say the students table, every time you want to find your trial students. This feature will ultimately live across multiple pages in the software (students, contacts, staff, classes, and bookings), but as with everything we build, it will be released intermittently and improved over time.

Zapier/webhooks Integration,"We don't love seeing you use other tools  but we get it - sometimes it just feels good to zap this to that! Now you can zap over to Zapier and trigger a webhook via ClassKid's Automations. Get crazy creative! Example: Trigger a doc for e-signature via DocuSign when a student converts to ""Active"" in ClassKid.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/38-zapier-webhooks-integration,classkid
E-signature ðŸª„,"We're adding electronic signatures (E-signatures) to the sign-up step of your store  giving your contacts the ability to sign terms and conditions on the fly, without any hassle or delay. If activated, this will replace the terms and conditions tick box, and request a full digital signature instead.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/67-e-signature,classkid
Liquid ðŸª„,"Add the first name  class title, booking start time, student birthdate, etc., to specific automations - namely emails and text messages. Ex: Hi Austin, Penelope's is all booked in for Ballet 1 tomorrow. Their trial class begins at 5pm CT... yada yada. This functionality will also be added to campaigns, which is just a sequence or ""series"" of texts, emails, and delays all put together.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/22-liquid,classkid
Reports ðŸª„,"When we launched our MVP last June  we initially provided the top 10 reports and since then we've added a slue of new features ta boot. That means we need to revisit reports now to ensure they're operating efficiently. These enhancements include updating filters, optimizing the layout so that data is more easily imported into other tools like Quickbooks, style changes to the PDF version of reports, and more. We'll also tweak the Dashboard to streamline its look and feel.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/59-reports,classkid
Confirmations & Reminders,"Send a pre-defined or ""templated"" email when a new booking occurs and remind parents about their child's booking  for example, one day and hour beforehand. This feature requires dynamic fields (liquid) so that you can write the email once and have it auto populate info like the child's name, lesson start time, etc. It works via SMS and email, too. In the end, this allows you to confirm a child's trial booking and remind the family before it starts. This way you can decrease no-show's and increase conversions! Please note - The more robust campaigns builder is a separate feature.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/53-confirmations-reminders,classkid
Weekly Billing,"Charge tuition weekly on a specific day. So let's say a student enrolls in a 9-month season or 12-week term  you'll be able to invoice them on Friday and charge on Saturday, or whatever days you want. This allows you to customize the ""billing cadence"", which determines how often you charge for tuition.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/12-weekly-billing,classkid
Payment Collection,"This enhancement allows you to customize how a contact is charged when a student enrolls. For example  you can specify if you'd like the system to collect the first payment, or the first and last payment upon registration. We're also adding another enhancement called ""pre-registration"" so that you can customize how this works if the class hasn't started yet.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/71-payment-collection,classkid
Membership Fees ðŸª„,"You already have the ability to charge a membership/registration fee when a student enrolls  but with this enhancement you can empower contacts (parents) to select their membership level and grant various benefits as a result. If you've setup multiple fees (ex: basic and premium), contacts would be required to select their fee in the checkout process before they pay. You'd be able to do this on their behalf when you use the existing admin-side checkout too.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/73-membership-fees,classkid
Inbox,"View  reply to, and manage inbound text messages and emails. The Messenger Integration will also tie into this, so that you can easily manage your Facebook and Instagram messages in ClassKid too.

",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/26-inbox,classkid
Facebook Pixel Integration,"Track specific events that occur in ClassKid within Facebook ads manager so that you know which ads are performing best.

Skills Tracking,"Track the achievement of a specific skill  goal, or milestone for students in ClassKid and update parents along the way. Reward students with lesson tokens, merchandise credits, and more as they reach new milestones and hone new skills.

Contracts & Waivers ðŸª„,"With this enhancement  you'll be able to customize your sign-up flow to include any necessary contracts or waivers that your customers need to sign. Once you've created your contract or waiver, you can easily add it to the sign-up step in the store, so your customers can agree to it in a single click. Currently, terms and conditions are linked to in general settings, but not hosted in ClassKid.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/68-contracts-waivers,classkid
Subscriptions,"Now you can create a miscellaneous subscription for just about anything in ClassKid. So if you want to break down your fees over 3 monthly payments or finance the purchase of a grand piano for a specific family  it's easy to do. Recurring payments related to classes should be created as tuition/package or promo.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/60-subscriptions,classkid
Account Management ðŸª„,"You can already enroll your students in classes  promos, packages (and more!) from the admin, as well as cancel the student from those classes when needed. Now, Account Management enhancements will empower you with better visibility and customization for each class or group of classes. Imagine this scenario: a student wants to switch classes within a Package. Instead of canceling the entire Package, you can seamlessly transfer them to the new class, ensuring a smooth transition without any unnecessary billing disruptions. Also, when a student decides to cancel a class, you'll have the ability to provide a custom reason for the cancellation. This allows for clear communication across the facility and better record-keeping. All of this and more will be possible with Account Management, and we think youâ€™ll love it.Â 
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/74-account-management,classkid
Termly Billing,"Charge tuition termly (on specific dates). Let's say a student enrolls in a 9-month season or 12-week term. With termly billing  you'll be able to create a billing rule that only bills parents on specific dates, in addition to monthly and upfront/in full like we have now. In other words, once complete this will show up as an additional option when creating billing rules.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/35-termly-billing,classkid
Campaigns (replaces Drip),"Create a drip sequence of text messages  emails, and/or delays. You could use this to nurture new leads, remind prospects about a trial booking, follow up after the trial, welcome new students when they enroll and more! We'll also enhance Automations so you can do things like triggering a welcome campaign when a student enrolls or removing their contact from the follow-up automatically, whenever they convert to active. Yipeee! This is a fun one to build and we're confident you'll love it.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/23-campaigns-replaces-drip,classkid

With this feature, contacts can select their preferred instructor, choose their instrument or class, pick a day and time, and complete the booking process - all within a few clicks. The entire process is quick, easy, and hassle-free.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/57-private-lessons,classkid

",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/10-packages,classkid
Time Tracking,"Track your staff people's hours worked  time off, and substitutes. AND automatically affect how much they're paid accordingly. Example: Martha fills in for Jane's one hour class on a random Tuesday. As a result the system deducts that hour worked from Jane's pay and pays Marth for that hour instead.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/49-time-tracking,classkid
Multi-tasking  ðŸª„,"Maybe you start writing an email and that triggers a thought - ""I forgot to follow up with Penelope's Mom!"" So you need the ability to quickly create a task  without leaving the email builder screen. Or maybe you're creating a payment and you want to leave a note on the account, without leaving the payment pop up. Multi-tasking will allow you to perform multiple quick actions at the same time.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/41-multi-tasking,classkid
Registration Forms,"Customize the default registration form to collect more information about a student or family. You can create any number of forms - for example  maybe you want a specific form for your comp team classes and then another form for your rec classes. You might also create custom reg forms for special, one-off events to collect a participants t-shirt size, snack item, or allergies.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/29-registration-forms,classkid
Notifications,"No more worrying about checking multiple sources for updates or searching through your inbox. ClassKid's new notifications center will capture various kinds of notifications  including messages that fail to send, classes that have ended and are no longer showing in store, and much more. Much like notifications in Facebook, you'll find all the most important updates for your facility in this one centralized location.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/63-notifications,classkid
Cash & Check Payments,"While you've always been able to charge customers and accept payments using their card on file  this enhancement gives you the option to take cash and check payments as well. With this update, you can effortlessly accept one-off cash or check payments for miscellaneous items, collect cash or check payments during enrollment, and apply cash or check payments to upcoming invoices (instead of automatically charging the card on file).
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/79-cash-check-payments,classkid

",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/77-seasons,classkid

SMS Builder,"A newer  cleaner, simpler SMS builder is coming to a ClassKid account near you!

Pre-registration,"This enhancement allows you to customize how a contact is charged during pre-registration (before the class begins). For example  you can choose to collect the registration fee and payments according to your payment collection default, or just the registration fee. Alternatively, you can choose not to collect the fee and payments upfront, and charge those on the first payment day in your season. 
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/72-pre-registration,classkid
Bulk Actions,"This feature allows you to perform a bulk action that may not be possible in smart search using the filtered state of a table or page in your account. For example  maybe you want to apply a tag to everyone who's already in a specific class. Instead of applying that tag to each person one by one, you'd simply filter the student's table so you see everyone in that class, then click ""apply bulk action"" and add the tag. This works for all actions in the system - ie new payment, sms, email, tag, etc. Can't wait for this one!
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/55-bulk-actions,classkid
Costume Management,"Need to keep track of which costume is for which kid? Want to sell required costumes/merch when a student enrolls? Then you'll love our costume management feature!

",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/75-coupons,classkid
Schedules,"Schedules are like collections of classes. You can essentially create a mini online store for specific classes that have something in common. For example  you could create a schedule for all of your Rec classes, Ballet classes, or Comp team classes. Or maybe you want to show all classes available in your 2 for $20 marketing promo. Super powerful! Every schedule has its own URL too - that way it's easy to drill down and fill spots in specific programs and classes.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/27-schedules,classkid
Survey Forms,"Create tailored surveys to gather all the information you need from your contacts and students with Survey Forms. No need to navigate to external sites like Google Forms. With this feature  you can easily collect and organize data - all in ClassKid.

Age Validation (by date) ðŸª„,"We've already added the ability to override age requirements in the admin  and we've recently shipped a new enhancement that allows students to enroll in a class if they'll be the correct age by the time the first/next lesson begins. Now, we're working on adding the option to validate a student's age by a specific date. This way you can validate age requirements just like your local school(s).

Class Transfer,"Easily transfer a student from one class to another and  if applicable, apply a credit from their previous payment to the new class. All of this in only a few clicks!

Direct Messaging,"Similar to team app or Facebook group messages  the direct messaging feature would allow you, your staff, and your families/students to chat one on one or one to many (as a group). You'd also be able to integrate this feature into your website so that prospective customers can chat with you if they have a quick question while looking around. Of course, you'd have complete control over which pieces of this feature you use. For example, you could leverage the website chat feature, but not allow parents to direct message you through their account. You could prevent students from being able to chat with instructors, etc.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/47-direct-messaging,classkid
Split Contact Billing,"Split the student's charges across two contacts automatically on the normal/recurring billing date by creating a rule that tells ClassKid which contact to charge and how much. You'll also be able to link more than one contact to a student for the purpose of communication. So now if Mom and Dad are divorced or if Gma pays for a portion of Penelope's tuition  you can charge the accounts automatically instead of using a workaround. Wahoo!
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/8-split-contact-billing,classkid
Affirm/Klarna Integration,"Offer end users (parents) the option to finance their purchase  but you (as the facility) would still receive your funds in full - made possible through a 3rd party integration with tools like Affirm, Sezzle, Afterpay or Klarna.

",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/37-inventory-mangement,classkid
Processing Fees,"Pass the processing fee onto end users (Contacts/parents) by activating the processing fee in general settings. For example  if the processing fee is 3 percent, the system will add three percent to every purchase. This way you don't have to eat all or any of the credit card fees.
",https://portal.productboard.com/classkid/1-classkid-roadmap/c/16-processing-fees,classkid
Credits System,"For whatever reason  you owe a contact (parent) some moolah! As a result, you need the ability to add credits to accounts - either to be used as an outstanding credit, in which case the system will use the credit 'til it runs out, or towards/applied to a specific billing cycle or payment in the future.

Forms (replaces ClickFunnels),"Instead of using yet another tool like LeadPages or Click Funnels for your landing pages/marketing funnels  you'll have the ability to create funnels in ClassKid.
