Multitasking,"For those of you that have agents that handle multiple queues at once  we'll be introducing the ability to schedule multiple workstreams at the same time and have adherence properly tracked regardless of which workstream the agent is working in.Examples of how you can use multitasking:Schedule an agent's primary channel to be phone and secondary to be email tickets. When the agent isn't on the phone they can handle email tickets in the queue. Forecast unique email queues (e.g. Billing & Tier 1 Support) independently but schedule an agent to handle them at the same time. This way whether an agent is working on Billing or Tier 1 tickets they are tracked as in adherence.Apply for for a closed Early Access here!!
