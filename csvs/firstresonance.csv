"Lights  camera, ACTIONS!","Introducing a giant leap toward the programmable factory of the future: ION Actions. Actions allow you to program logic (e.g. validation rules) into your factory using code  expanding engineering possibilities in your factory, programmatically. This is the start of something BIG. A few pre-built Actions ready to deploy upon request:Prevent a Procedure from reaching ‘In Review’ status if:Steps don’t have dependenciesSteps don’t have locations filled outPrevent an Issue ticket’s creation without required fieldsPrevent an Issue’s closure without conditionally required fields.Require managerial approvals on Purchase Orders based on the dollar amount orderedProcedure submission to “In review” is only allowed by user with specific permissions.Help us, help you, build ACTIONS!If you’d like Actions deployed, please start by answering:What business problem would be solved by your Action andWhat is your proposed solution (e.g. which conditions should warn/block an ION user?)
