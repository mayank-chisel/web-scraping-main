Reassign & Stop Admin Action on Workflows,"We understand that workflows sometimes need to adapt when assignments change. Currently  the only option is to forward the assignment email, but this makes it difficult to track the completion of the workflow. That's why we're considering a new feature that would allow admins to re-assign workflow steps to someone else within their organization right from the admin dashboard.This would come in handy in situations like when an assignee is on vacation or out sick, and another person needs to take over.We'd love to know if you're interested in having the ability to re-assign or stop a running Copilot workflow through the admin dashboard.Disclaimer: The posts available here, including in the “Under Consideration” and “Planned” tabs, are the best reflection of what the teams are currently working on in each product. Unless located in the “Launched” tab, this is not a commitment to a specific feature or release date, but it should help you understand the priorities of each of our product teams.
