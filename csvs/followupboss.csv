Contact Relationship,"Contact Relationships OverviewUse Relationships to communicate with related contacts in one place. Think: spouses  business partners, father and son, etc. You can start conversations with more than one person and all communication with these related contacts will show on the same profile. Now it's easy to see the whole conversation and keep everyone in the loop.Note: If you are needing or wanting two people to be separate contacts in a third party system, keep them separate in Follow Up Boss. If you want to roll up people in a primary relationship instead, use Relationships.

Lead Profile Add Custom Field Folders,"ProblemCustomers need to maximize the efficiency of prospecting from their leads in FUB. After focusing on new leads and responding to inbound who they you focus on? Often there are positive signals (desire to move right away  qualified for financing, re-locating for work, etc...) in the communication touch points that reveal buyers/sellers most likely to transact. It is typical to have thousands of leads who are dormant and hundreds who are actively looking for homes so it is critical to be able to filter these to a manageable list.SolutionUpdate the custom fields admin to handle folders. This should look and behave like the Email Templates admin.Custom fields can be in multiple folders.Search input to quickly find a custom field.Default folder at the top: ""All Custom Fields""Folders can be re-ordered.Option to track progress per folder.Similar to Email Templates Admin the page will default to a folder list.

Calling/Texting For International Inbound/Outbound,"FULLY SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL CALLING/TEXTINGA lead with an international phone number can call or text your Follow Up Boss number  but you can't call/text their international number from Follow Up Boss and we can't call/text your international cell phone number (for call forwarding and lead alert texts, for example).Quick note: In this context, ""International"" means a number other than American or Canadian. Both American and Canadian numbers use the +1 country code on phone numbers and are not considered ""international"". All other country codes (+52 in Mexico, +971 in UAE, etc.) are ""international"" for the purposes of this feature.

Pond Notifications Settings,"Problem Teams often setup numerous ponds to denote lead value/urgency and focus areas. Currently  only the Pond Lead Agent gets notified of lead activity in the pond. This creates overhead as the Pond Agent needs to then notify the team that something has happened. There is also various workflows team deploy with geo ponds, ISA fallback, ISA warm capture, high urgency, etc. that have very specific notification scenarios. Solution To handle these specific Pond scenarios we will allow for teams to set notifications at the Pond Level via our newly released setting screen. We will simply list out the ponds and allow them to specify. ~ Scope: New notifications for Lead ClaimedWe will add a claimed lead notification to address the need to see who is clamining leads for team leads to monitor activity. This will work just like Lead Released to Pond. When enabled they be notified via bell, email, and desktop, & mobile push using the same format as lead released. We will also add browser push to released to pond.

Automations: Calendar Date Trigger Event,"ProblemAlthough we are collecting important dates for contacts  there isn't a way to automatically action these dates. For example:FUB cannot automatically send an email to a contact or assign a task to an agent to call a lead for an important date like a birthday or an anniversaryFUB cannot automatically start a post-closing action plan when a deal is closedCustom dates and deal close dates are both used as filters in the calendar and individually can be found in smart lists, deals and reporting. However, users need to manually monitor calendar, smart lists, deals and reporting to action these dates.  As a manual process, agents are missing key touchpoints when one of these dates falls on a weekend and brokers have a hard time prescribing a workflow. Additionally, users aren't incentivized to enter these dates to begin with which prevents them from getting the full value from other parts of the app. Providing value for these dates via automation will encourage users to enter these dates, it will allow brokers to set up important workflows and no important dates will slip through the cracks.

Access to multiple accounts,"ProblemCurrently  customers can access only one Follow Up Boss account with their email / password so they have to create multiple distinct logins to access their multiple FUB accounts. Customers usually need separate FUB accounts to split their business geographically or to limit user access within each company division. It also makes it hard for real estate coaches to access FUB accounts of their clients. They need to have a unique login / password to access FUB account of each individual client. SolutionAllow users to access multiple FUB accounts using one login / password. This is accomplished by decoupling a user account (belongs to one natural person) from FUB account (one tenant). It means the same person can login into multiple FUB accounts using the same email address / password or Google/Microsoft sign-in.

Action Plan: Add Step - Notes With @mention Support,"Problem Customers desire workflow Automations that inform their teams to action and as more and more of our customers retarget contacts & setup ISA teams or Require their Agents to action these prime events they need a way to notify the team when those prime events have occurred in one of their workflows. Customer Feedback:Existing Lead: New Property Inquiry  Y-Priority Tag, Property Saved Event: When there is a key event such as a new inquiry for an existing lead, we can notify more than the assigned agent such as the ISA Team in charge of looking for these events. Robert Slack is using this approach heavily today.Pond (Existing Lead: New Property Inquiry) only the Pond Lead Agent gets notified of the activity in Ponds currently. This creates overhead as the Pond Agent(Team Lead) needs to then notify the team if they need someone to action the lead.

There are similar ones such as AnniversariesFor all the downstream birthday things (smart lists, calendar views, etc) it would be really great if there was one single Birthday field that could be used everywhere, even if there were multiple relations with birthdays on the same Person page.

Allow Duplicates,"Problem:When an agent on a team purchases a lead  it is possible that the lead is already in Follow Up Boss assigned to a different agent. When this happens, the existing lead profile is updated with the most recent activity and the agent assigned to the existing profile is notified of new activity. This gives them an advantage over the agent that actually purchased the lead. Solution: Add an ""Allow Duplicates"" option for specific Lead Flows and Imports. If a particular Lead Flow is marked to allow duplicates, we could check for duplicates at the assigned agent level instead of at the account level. This would create a new lead for the agent assigned via lead flow even if the lead was assigned to a different agent. If the lead was assigned to a different agent, we would not update that profile.If an Import was marked to allow duplicates, we could check check for duplicates within the import and check for duplicates at the assigned agent level, but we would bypass the duplicate check at the account level. This would allow agent's to import their sphere without updating a lead profile assigned to a different agent.

Automations: Shared Automations,"ProblemWe don’t have a way to share automations between accounts. We need to rely solely on pre-loaded automations or unactionable screenshots. We want power users  coaches, and our internal success/support/sales teams to be able to easily share successful automations and tie them into a workflow. Right now, we are getting a lot of tickets that require the manual efforts of our support and success teams to guide users in setting up new powerful automation where an easy way to share could save a lot of time.The workflows that coaches prescribe are both unique and intricate, using a series of automations.  Someone asking, “Can I have Barry Jenkins automation workflow” could mean support/success creating +12 automations.  Here are two different sets of enabled automations on single accounts:Making automations shareable will improve adoption of the automations tool, by giving it more attention in our success communities and make automations easier to turn on and start using. We can crowdsource the prescriptive nature of these workflows.  On the back end and we can gain a lot of information on what automations are the most shared and most used to make future decisions with pre-loaded automations and how to structure and share content in automation library. Our usage of the Action Plan library is pretty low (<2%). I think this is likely to do with the quantity and the quality of the content that is shared. It would be worth experimenting with a different approach.

Business Domain Email Sharing,"Problem: It's expected that RE Teams often share responsibility for connecting with leads. The issue currently is teams have to perform extra steps and in some case just can't see relative information to collaborate with contacts. A good example of this is when a Contact is in a Pond as we have seen agents accidentally sending duplicate emails to leads & struggle to follow communications with leads as they can't see the email sent from other agents. Solution It's expected that teams all using the same business email domains(followupboss.com) that when ""sharing emails"" is checked that in all cases that account emails (joe.kulick@followupboss.com) would be shared with everyone on the team. We will start with allowing teams to do this via a power-up at first to pilot and learn what else is needed to safeguard any concerns. Scope 1: We will include a new Power-Up to allow for global business domains to be shared. Once enabled we will use the owner's domain as the domain matching and from there if a team member account matches they will be added /w sharing enabled.Scope 2:  For domain accounts already connected or when a team member connects their business email account with this power-up enabled. We will send a notification email to let them know that domain email sharing is on for their account. Subject: Business Domain Email Sharing Enabled Dan Corkill(Account Owner) has enabled business domain email sharing on your joe.kulick@followupboss email address. Your email content will be viewable by other team members on any contacts that are assigned to  in a shared Pond with, or added as a collaborator on. You can learn more about email sharing here.

Business Insights Email Rollup,"ProblemOverall we have a very large amount of data (some that we never surface) that are spread out between multiple reports/filters. Because different metrics are found across multiple reports and because there aren’t Goals to track against in FUB  customers are making custom reports in excel and copying values from FUB reporting manually. This is the only way for owners/admins to answer the questions such as “Is my business on track?”, “Are my agents performing well?”, “What lead sources have the most output”, “What are my areas of opportunity?” by looking at one report. SolutionMake it easier for admins to keep a pulse on key performance metrics and enhance accountability by easily surfacing key KPIs that can be tracked against goals. There are improvements we can make to each one of the existing report but to get to actualized value quickly and begin to iterate on this, I think a good start would be adding a rolled-up email report would be a good place to start. This rolled-up report will be available on a weekly basis and sent to the account owner. It should be sent at 8a Friday morning and should include data from the previous Friday (12a) - Thursday (11:59pm).

The metrics included are:Number of new leads this week + % change from the previous weekNumber of unactioned new leads this week + % change from the previous weekNumber of appointments set with new leads this week + % change from the previous weekLead Sources This section will give a high-level overview of this week's lead source performance. It should include a ""See more"" link that will bring you to the Lead Sources Report. It should include this week's Top 5 lead sources this week + the number of leads per source. Stage Pipeline  This section will include a high-level overview of the New Leads stages. The section should include a ""See more"" that links to the People table. When there is a Pipeline report, we should update the link so that it goes there.

Robust Call Reporting,"ProblemThe only call reporting we currently have is fixed  aggregate call metrics that are filterable by Teams and Agents.  This is problematic for a few reasons: There is no way to filter by a particular inbox or the individual number within the inbox. The inbox and inbox numbers are representative of particular marketing initiatives (such a Google LSA) and can be representative of internal workflows (ISA Inbox). With the existing limited amount of metrics, it's difficult to surface coaching opportunities or understand if your team inboxes are being worked effectively. Because there is only aggregate call data its difficult to find the calls that contributed to a particular metric. During coaching calls, admins need to click through various profiles to listen to particular calls. Solution:Add Team Inbox filters to the existing Call report so that customers that have access to a team inbox can see how effectively the team inbox is being worked and how successful the inbox is as it relates to new leadsProvide additional metrics will be added to easily surface the efficacy of the current workflows and coaching opportunitiesA toggle will be added so the person viewing the report can toggle between the aggregate data and call logs for the filters givenTeam Inbox Filters Add Team Inboxes to the User Filter drop-down on the right. ~Collapse all filtering options besides ""Everyone"" and ""Me"" into Categories: Teams, Users and Inboxes. This will make filtering by inboxes more discoverable for people that have large lists of users, teams and inboxes ﻿Selecting ""All Inboxes"" or a particular Inbox will filter for calls made with or to the Team inbox number(s) selected in a period of time. Selecting ""All Inboxes"" will show each inbox name as a row. Selecting an Individual Inbox will show each phone number (and label is there is a label) as a row.  ﻿New Metrics Along with the existing columns (Calls Made, Calls Connected, Call Conversations, Calls Received, Calls Missed, Talk Time) add the following metrics to the Call Report:Inbound Answer Rate: Calls Received/Inbound Calls AnsweredInbound Calls Answered: Number of calls to the team inbox number that were answered. Note call duration should not be accounted for unless we need to prevent ""false positive"" answers. It would be acceptable to add a ~5 second talk time, for example.Outbound Answer Rate: Calls Made/Outbound Calls AnsweredOutbound Calls Answered: Number of calls from the team inbox number that were answered. Note call duration should not be accounted for unless we need to prevent ""false positive"" answers. It would be acceptable to add a ~5 second talk time, for exampleInbound Talk Time: total time on inbound callsOutbound Talk time: total time on outbound callsVoicemails: Number of voicemails that were left on the team inbox in a given weekTotal Calls: Calls Made + Calls ReceivedNew Leads Added: An unknown number calls the team inbox in the given time frame and is then later added as a lead in that same timeframe, we should count that towards New Leads Added. If the lead previously called outside of the timeframe and then was added during the timeframe, do not count towards new leads added.   Tech Note: This is potentially a trickier one to make happen behind the scenes without perhaps adding some database changes, which may mean we may not be able to back populate it. Back populating is acceptable. Calls from New Leads: If an unknown number calls the inbox, count towards calls from New Leads~Transferred calls: Number of calls that were transferred to or from the inbox

Calling: Call Waiting on Desktop,"ProblemCustomers often fail to answer valuable inbound calls when they are dialing outbound to lower value leads. For example--an ISA is dialing a call list and most of the time is spent waiting for callee to answer and we currently don't notify them on desktop there is another inbound call. The current behavior to silence inbound while a customer is dialing is not proportional with the value of inbound vs outbound. Inbound is typically someone who wants to engage with your service  outbound is typically to someone that has to be persuaded and may be a bit hostile.SolutionDesktopProvide visual and audio queue that there is a call waiting when a user is currently on a call. For the first version we will support two options.End & Accept. Hang up current call and answer incoming.Decline. Stop notification to user who declines. If a team inbox call then other team inbox members still can answer.Mobile Forward the incoming call even if we know the user is on another call and their setting is to 'ring both'. The device built-in call-waiting feature will allow the user to decline, end and answer or hold and answer.

"""View in"" multiple third parties","In the Activity section  there is the option to ""View in [third party]"". This is a useful tool that helps agents navigate quickly between FUB and elsewhere such as Ylopo, Zillow, REW, RealGeeks, etc.The ""View In..."" button is limited to one platform, however, it could be useful to view in multiple platforms. Other platforms may not have a robust integration with FUB and can still provide valuable information about the lead and assist in Following Up.
