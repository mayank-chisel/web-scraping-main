Category Filtering,"WhatImplementation of a category filter in the activity feed (later on in other areas of the app).WhyCurrently  there is no way to separate the activity cards by category. This makes it difficult for users who only care about a few categories to get the information needed. For example, brands could carry multiple categories, and with the current filtering system, you would get all the activities for these brands including irrelevant category activities. By adding category filtering, users would be able to select exactly what they need to see, and avoid the noise of other categories. QuestionsWhen you are searching by category, do you want to go narrower into brands? How many categories does your brand produce? How important is sub-categories to you (eg. package size, different kinds of edibles)?

Budtender Information,"Budtender education is one of the best tools that a brand has to increase sales in a store.A dashboard that gave information on budtenders could be incredibly helpful in Bridge. Things it could show:What % of budtenders sold your products?What % of your sales came from each budtender? (budtenders would be anonymized  so this would really just be a measure of if there are some unnamed champions of your products at this store)What else would you like to know about your sales and budtenders?

Activity Feed Location Filtering,"WhatWe would like to add city filters to help users narrow down specific areas to track in the activity feed. These filters would affect the Retailers filter - as it would only show stores within the cities and postal codes you've selected. It would also filter Brands filter that have activity in that area. WhyIn the activity feed right now  you can only filter by state/province, however, sales reps and retail owners may only want to see activity in their region of concern (competitive stores near your retail store, or sales rep's territory).

Do you ever need to assign regions by cities AND postal/zip code?Do you know the names of the retail stores you want to keep an eye out for?

Bridge: Provision accounts for brands and vendors,"Currently  there is no distinction between brands and distributors in Headset Bridge. Bridge data is provisioned based on whatever the Retailer has in their ""Vendor"" field in their POS. This makes it complicated if both a brand and their distributor want to subscribe. Headset is in the process of separating brand and distributor into two separate fields. In addition to letting us better show the right people the right data. We think that brands and distributors may have different needs when it comes to which data is important to see, so we'd love some feedback on what those differences may be!
