Identifying Intro Offer Products & Consumers 🔎 💁🏾‍♀️,"Overview:Currently there is no way for customer to indicate that a membership or credit package is an intro offer. This leads to problems with reporting and intro offer purchase limits (eg a customer can only buy this once).With this initial pass  we will enable you to indicate on a membership contract that it is an intro offer and provide these purchase limit settings. Intro offer identifiers will appear in reports so you can more easily track these payment options. In the future, we will eventually support the ability to see who is on an intro offer in the Roster and share upcoming expiring intro offers with you so you can engage those customers appropriately.What value this will deliver:By giving you more insight into your Intro Offer consumers, customers will be able to engage consumers at critical moments in the early stages of their consumer journey with a brand, driving retention.

I need to make changes to existing contracts when: 1. I go through a pricing change2. My grand opening is delayed and I need to change the start date of my contracts3. I want to start allowing (or stop allowing) guest passes Because I cannot make updates to existing contracts, I have to go through several cumbersome workflows to facilitate these changes: 1. Make pricing changes one at a time in the customer profile2. Change contract start dates one at a time in the customer profile3. Terminate the current contract and resell the new contract -- This impacts my membership KPIs, including making it challenging to determine my true churn rate.
