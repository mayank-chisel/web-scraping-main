Add a queue when the room is full,"OverviewWe just launched two improvements to how attendees join sessions on Demio.First  we've added a formal queue system to manage attendees once attendance exceeds the room size—we'll add new attendees to a queue where access will be granted as spots open up.Additionally, admins will be notified once the room reaches capacity, along with a clear indication of how many attendees are in the queue.Next, we've adjusted the room flow to show the Join Room anytime someone accesses their join link. This change ensures that only those who join the room will be added to the queue and allow us to auto-redirect attendees to the room once a session begins (previously, they would need to click Join once the session started before gaining access to the room).This change will mean attendees that join the session before it goes live will be in the room right as the session starts, ensuring they don't miss those first crucial moments.Note: The room queue will only apply to Attendees.

"Minor Room Improvements: Translucent Stage Cards  New Avatars, and More!","Translucent Stage CardsBased on some recent feedback  we've updated the stage cards within the room to use a translucent background when users aren't sharing their cameras. This change should provide a more branded appearance to the cards, allowing the background color to shine. New Avatars We've added new placeholder avatars for people who don't have a Gravatar associated with their email address. The new style opts for a more neutral look to ensure that it works well with any/all brand colors used for your events. Note: You'll find the new placeholder avatar styles in the room, directly in the account (for event admins and team members), as well as on public registration/replay pages for featured presenters.
