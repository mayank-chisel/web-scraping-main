Status column & pending updates,"🗒️ tldrUsers want to have control over when their automations are triggered. To enable this  we've designed a Status column to indicate which records haven't been ""sent to their Zaps"" yet and a ""Pending updates"" button to trigger them. 🎨 Designsfigma☑️ Scope(1) Status Column: a fixed column on the left that's always present. It has three states:Blank: default state""pending"" tag: when a record has been updated, but not sent to the connected Zaps yetActivity spinner: displayed for 10 seconds after the ""process"" button has been pressed(2) Pending updates button: a button that releases the pending messages and triggers their corresponding Zaps.This button has 5 states:Inactive: when no records are pendingEnabled (nothing selected): when records are pending but no specific records are selectedEnabled (with records selected): shows the number of connected records and the user can process just those messagesHover & Focused: similar to active, depending on whether records are selected the text will change(3) “Ignore pending records”: users can choose to dismiss/ignore the pending messages in order to keep the update, but not trigger the connected Zaps.👱 User StoriesNo Zaps Setup (figma): As a user with no Zaps setup, I should see the Status column and the “Records up to date” button, but it’ll be inactive. When I hover over the button, a tool tip should display with text and a link.New Record (figma):As a user with a Zap setup using the “New Record” trigger, when I create a new record in should enter the pending state. Updated Record (figma):As a user with a Zap setup using the “Updated Record” trigger without the optional Trigger Field defined, when I update a record in should enter the pending state. Updated Field (figma):As a user with a Zap setup using the “Updated Record” trigger with the optional Trigger Field defined, when I update that field the record should enter the pending state. As a user with a Zap setup using the “Updated Record” trigger with the optional Trigger Field defined, when I update any other field the record should not enter the pending state. Ignore Records (figma):As a user with a few pending records, I’d like to select them, then hit the “Ignore Records” button to dismiss their pending state. Process all pending records (figma):As a user with 1 or more pending records (and none selected), I’d like to press “Process” to process all the messages.Process selected updates (figma):As a user with 1 or more pending records selected, I’d like to press “Process” to process the messages.Close computer and come back tomorrow:As a user with a few pending messages, I’d like them to persist when I come back tomorrow. If a colleague opened the same Table, they should see the too (in the future when we support sharing).As a user with multiple Record Updated Zaps (ie: one general one and one that only fires when a specific column is updated), if I edit the whole record and the specific field, both Zaps would be triggered when the record is processed (figma).💡 Misc ScenariosAs a rule of thumb, the latest version of the record is the one that is sent to the Zap when it’s processed. Create a record, edit the record, then press “process” will trigger “New Record”Edit a record, then delete it will not fire a trigger. The “Edit” event was never processed and the delete record doesn’t have a trigger (yet).💡 NotesThe pending button and status column are always presentA record becomes pending if it's edited and there's a Zap with a trigger listening to it (either a New Record or Updated Record Zap).If the trigger is filtered for a specific field/column, then only if that field is changed does the record become pending.When a field is updated, it's immediately saved to the database.We'll have to keep track of the pending state for records between sessions. In the future, when there are multiple users, they'll all see the same pending states.
